## Calculating Number of Surface Atoms for Nanoparticles
This script launches the following GUI. Given a metal symbol, a nanoparticle shape, and the corresponding raidus or length, the calculator can be used to calculate the number and percetage of atoms which are loacted on the nanoparticle surface. This only serves as an estimate, and the results tend to be more accurate when the nanoparticle becomes larger.
